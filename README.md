# s3put
 Upload files to s3 easily

You will need to compile the jar in intellij, as I use shadow jar + the s3 libraries the file is ~160MB. Too big for github. 
or I guess this link but it probably won't be updated https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lw9e8KYIjE71HC5PsZnP0uFn4flvxnAG/view?usp=sharing

java -jar s3put.jar <file:folder>
